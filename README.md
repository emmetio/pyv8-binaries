For Sublime Text 2 Unpack contents of downloaded archive into `PyV8/%filename%` folder inside Sublime Text Packages (find `Browse Packages...` menu item in ST2 editor to get into Packages folder), where `%filename%` is the name of downloaded file (e.g. it will be `pyv8-win64-p3` if you download `pyv8-win64-p3.zip` file).

For Sublime Text 3 Unpack contents of downloaded archive into `PyV8/%filename%` folder inside Sublime Text Installed Packages (find `Browse Packages...` menu item under preferences in ST3 editor to get into Packages folder, go up one level and go into Installed Packages), where `%filename%` is the name of downloaded file (e.g. it will be `pyv8-win64-p3` if you download `pyv8-win64-p3.zip` file).
